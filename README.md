# login-system-with-email-confirmation-django
Basic login system with email confirmation using the Django web framework. The login system will require users to confirm their email address before they can access the website. This will help to ensure that only valid users are able to log in and use the website.

The project will involve the following tasks:

User Registration: Users will be able to register on the website by providing their email address and password. Upon successful registration, an email will be sent to the userâ€™s email address with a confirmation link.

Email Confirmation: When the user clicks on the confirmation link in the email, their account will be activated and they will be able to log in.

Login: Once a user has confirmed their email address, they will be able to log in using their email address and password.

Admin Panel: An admin panel will be provided to manage users and their profiles.
